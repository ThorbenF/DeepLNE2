# DeepLNE2
Repository for 'Knowledge distillation of DeepLNE for accelerated multi-state reaction path free energy estimations'

Content:

- DeepLNE class with example usage

- Tutorial of the knowledge distillation framework to train a computationally fast DeepLNE model and use it as a biased CV (System: Particle in Muller-Brown potential)

- All scripts to produce the figures of main text and SI.
- All analysis scripts needed to reproduce results published in this study.

COLVAR and MD trajectories for the systems studied are available at https://zenodo.org/records/11111 and should be replaced with the 'data' directory for successful execution of the jupyter notebooks provided.
